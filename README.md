- Integrate a nested view with our application

Let's build a mini fake Twitter. We've got a home page, and inside that home page we'd like to have the nested views for the user's timeline, their notifications and a user profile.

Configure the four routes that we need, with the correct URLs and templates. Also - configure the navigation for our home page!
